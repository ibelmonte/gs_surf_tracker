# Code review

If full review requested then perform a code review on the full code base. Otherwise, if a valid feature is mentioned then do a review of that feature, if not then do a review of the most recent feature developed.

Then next is a comprehensive checklist for conducting thorough code reviews to ensure quality, security, and maintainability:

### Functionality
- [ ] Code does what it's supposed to do
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logic errors

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code is readable and well-structured
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Follows project conventions and rules
- [ ] No lint disabling

### Security
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation is present
- [ ] Sensitive data is handled properly
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets

Fix systematically any issues found, starting from the critical ones.
