Alembic Database Migrations
===========================

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Common Commands

### Create a new migration (auto-generate from model changes)
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

### Create a blank migration
```bash
alembic revision -m "description of changes"
```

### Apply all pending migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback one migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### View current migration status
```bash
alembic current
```

### View migration history
```bash
alembic history
```

## Initial Setup

To create the initial database schema:

```bash
# Generate initial migration from current models
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial schema"

# Apply the migration
alembic upgrade head
```

## Notes

- The database URL is automatically loaded from the DATABASE_URL environment variable
- All models must be imported in alembic/env.py for autogenerate to work
- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying them
